## Lab 1: Data Clustering using K-means
### Introduction
In this laboratory session, we explore the fundamentals of data clustering using the K-means algorithm. K-means is a simple yet effective clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct non-overlapping groups (clusters). The objective is to create homogeneous groups where data points within the same group are as similar as possible, while maximizing dissimilarity between different groups.

### Implementation
#### Algorithm Implementation: 
Implement the K-means algorithm for a set of points in the plane and visualize the clustering results. You can utilize the provided source code accompanying the lab documentation. Test the implementation using points from the files knnpoints3.txt, knnpoints4.txt, and knnpoints_uniform.txt.
#### Determining Optimal K: 
Determine the optimal value of K, which yields compact and well-separated clusters, using the silhouette coefficient method. The silhouette coefficient (SC) measures the quality of clustering. It is calculated based on the average distance between points within clusters (a), and the minimum average distance between a point and points in other clusters (b). The silhouette coefficient for a point is given by s(i) = (b(i) â€“ a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i)). The best value of K is the one that maximizes the average silhouette coefficient.
